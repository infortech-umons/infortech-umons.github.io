# UMONS Research Institute for Information Technology and Computer Science

The [INFORTECH Institute](http://web.umons.ac.be/infortech) carries out fundamendal and applied research in computer science, information and communication technology, targeted to detecting, processing, transmitting, storing, analysing, and manipulating data and signals in all possible forms. The main research focus areas are: the [Internet of Things](tag/iot.html), [data analytics](tag/data-analytics), [machine learning](tag/machine-learning.html) and [artificial intelligence](tag/ai.html). 

INFORTECH consists of members from different Faculties and scientific disciplines, including but not limited to physical sciences, computer science, applied engineering and social sciences. INFORTECH members also collaborate closely with [MULTITEL](https://www.multitel.eu) and [CETIC](https://www.cetic.be), two research centres officially recognised by the [RÃ©gion wallonne](https://www.wallonie.be) (Belgian regional Government).
The collaborations enabled by this interdisciplinary research have led to the presence of a wide range of equipment and a diversity of skills within the Institute.
