# UMONS Research Institute for Information Technology and Computer Science

The INFORTECH Institute carries out fundamendal and applied research in computer science, information and communication technology, with a focus on the Internet of Things, machine Learning, artificial intelligence, and data science technologies for detecting, processing, transmitting, storing, analysing, and manipulating data and signals in all possible forms. INFORTECH consists of members from different Faculties and scientific disciplines, including but not limited to physical sciences, computer science, applied engineering and social sciences. The collaborations enabled by this interdisciplinary research have led to the presence of a wide range of equipment and a diversity of skills within the Institute. In the field of information technology, INFORTECH collaborates closely with the MULTITEL and CETIC, two research centres officially recognised by the RÃ©gion wallonne (Belgian regional Government).
