*NeoMI: a new environment for the organization of musical instruments*

The current Hornbostel-Sachs system to classify musical instruments is conceptually and practically outdated, because it has a reducing effect by only considering morphological features. Our research project NeoMI aims at developing a new environment for the organization of musical instruments that takes into account their many aspects. The goal is to develop an environment consisting in an integrated, non-hierarchical and flexible tool to organise musical instruments. Without reducing the complexity and the richness of these multifaceted objects, it includes the multitude of aspects of musical instruments into a unique environment. To that end, the system is based on temporary grouping instruments among their “peers”, according to user-based criteria. This allows an important variability in the precision level: it can be used to group instruments according to a single criterion (such as the presence of an anthropomorphic decoration on the instrument), to constitute a corpus of very specific instruments (for example, instruments equipped with devices providing buzzing sounds), or, on the contrary, to constitute a group of similar instruments from the same maker, at the same place, over time. NeoMI aims to provide a flexible and pertinent tool for managing museum collections, as well as a fruitful and innovative conceptual framework for research.  It explores three different axes: (1) the instrument as an artefact (production time and place, maker, morphological features, etc.); (2) the instrument in its social/cultural context; (3) the instrument as a tool for music. All axes will be addressed, but because the third axis -the instrument as a tool for music- is the most innovative one, the focus of the project is on the acoustic properties of musical instruments. To prevent bias towards an organization based on morphological traits, NeoMI focuses on one family of instruments: the fiddles, or bowed chordophones.
