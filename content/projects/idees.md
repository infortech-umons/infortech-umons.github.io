*[IDEES](https://www.cetic.be/IDEES): The Internet of Tomorrow to develop business, economy and society*

The Internet of Tomorrow is one of the pillars of the European strategy. The IDEES project portfolio aims to promote the implementation of this strategy in Wallonia. The first project concerns the [technological foundations](https://www.cetic.be/IDEES-Technology-Foundations) needed to achieve the desired progress. It builds on the considerable advances that have been made recently in these areas (*cloud computing, big data analytics and Internet of Things*), and aims to improve them to enable companies to benefit from them. The second project aims to *implement co-innovation with companies to accelerate the adoption of these technologies and to optimise their value* in the sectors that use them. The third project *deploys pilot projects in specific sectors close to business clusters*, to validate the contribution of these modern technologies in various configurations.
