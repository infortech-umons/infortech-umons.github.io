*Structured Low-Rank Matrix/Tensor Approximation - Numerical Optimization-Based Algorithms and Applications*

Today's information society is centered on the collection of large amounts of data, from which countless applications aim at extracting information. They involve the manipulation of matrices and higher-order tensors, which can be viewed as large multi-way arrays containing numerical data. Key to their successful and efficient processing is the proper exploitation of available structure, and in particular low rank. This EOS project aims to contribute innovative structure-exploiting methods based on the paradigm of low-rank matrix/tensor approximation, with a strong mathematical and algorithmic emphasis, and to apply them to large-scale data analysis, information retrieval and modelling.

The [SeLMA](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/selma/) project consortium coordinated by KULeuven is lead by 4 Belgian principal investigators:
Lieven De Lathauwer (KULeuven), P.-A. Asil (UCLouvain), Ivan Makovsky (VUB) and Nicolas Gillis (UMONS)
