*CuDB : Quicker, greener and cheaper RDBMS engine*

With comparable price and power consumption, GPUs outperform CPUs in terms of computing performance thanks to their massive parallel data architecture.
Database engines (RDBMS) are common software components in most applications, regardless of their size, complexity and different uses, whether integrated or distributed. It is estimated today that more than one billion instances of such components are currently in use worldwide every day.
The key idea of CuDB was to design an RDBMS engine that runs natively on the GPU rather than on the CPU: scientific results have shown us that performance has been increased by several dozen times with a drastically low energy impact.
The objective of the CuDB project is now to transfer the results of the scientific research into a marketable product and to create the structure for its diffusion on the market.
