Low cost open hardware Metallic Additive Manufacturing technology

Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) is a sector in very strong growth. Today's technologies require a great deal of expertise and very significant investments (~1Mâ‚¬), which hinders the adoption of this process. More affordable processes are therefore in demand. FabricAr3v responds to this issue by designing a "low-cost" process and by developing dedicated simulation tools. More specifically, UMONS addresses the issues related to valorisation, i.e. technology dissemination, practicable business models, intellectual property (of the machine and the manufactured objects) and the creation of an open hardware ecosystem.
