*Towards an interdisciplinary, socio-technical methodology and analysis of the health of software ecosystems.*

[SECOHealth](https://secohealth.github.io) aims to understand and control the health of software ecosystems, where software ecosystems are interpreted as ecological ecosystems comprised of a population of living organisms (software projects and their communities of contributors). The goal is to (1) define a conceptual model of ecosystem health, then (2) determine health indicators capable of measuring the different aspects of such health, as well as determine events that affect the health of ecosystems; and (3) empirically validate these health indicators and events.
SECOHealth is an FNRS-FRQ Québec-Wallonie collaborative research project lead by Principal Investigators Tom Mens (University of Mons, Belgium), Bram Adams (Polytechnique Montreal, Canada) and Josianne Marsan (Laval University, Canada).
