*Fab-IoT-Lab: Internet of Things guidance and prototyping*

The Internet of Things is getting traction in many domains. New connected objets are being developed every day and are tackling more and more use cases in every domain. Industrial IoT allows to improve many aspects in various industries. The common point is the need to prototype, test and iterate in order to build better solutions. Since most companies do not have the resources to maintain a complete R&D department for their IoT projects, the Fab-IoT-Lab team can help them to choose the best sensor and transmission technologies and build fully functional prototypes.

Fab-IoT-Lab is an ERDF project, part of the DigiSTORM project portfolio.
It is led by Pr. Sébastien Bette (UMONS, Electromagnetism and Telecom Department), Pr. Enrico Filippi (FabLab Mons) and François Roland (UMONS, Electromagnetism and Telecom Department).
