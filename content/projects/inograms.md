*[INOGRAMS](https://www.cetic.be/INOGRAMS-en): INnOvations for a Global RAil Management System*

Railway operators face competition from airlines and road users and must therefore improve the internationalisation of traffic and interoperability between operators and infrastructure. The ERTMS standards, developed for Europe to meet this need, have spread around the world, highlighting, on the one hand, a request for changes to new functionalities and, on the other hand, the risk of emergence of non-European competition in the sector.

The Inograms project is an industrial research project that explores new technological axes to meet the needs of the non-European market of the ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System) by developing new features and significantly reducing the cost needed to maintain competitive solutions developed in Wallonia.
