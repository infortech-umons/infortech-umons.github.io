*[WAL-e-CITIES](https://www.walecities.eu): Make Wallonia a Smart Region*

The development of smart cities creates windows of opportunity to understand broad societal expectations. Smart cities will be able to collaborate in development projects that focus on more than just technology. UMONS is a partner of this project portfolio, which is managed by Multitel, and whose mission is to meet the challenges of Walloon cities using a *Smart Region* philosophy. The main objective of this portfolio is to develop devices and software to enable the delivery of services and meet needs in four areas: mobility, energy and the environment, transparent exchange of data, and the life and welfare of citizens. Wal-e-Cities develops technological and non-technological components, integrated to use the technology wisely and compare the results to the usersâ€™ specific needs (citizens, municipal authorities, local businesses, etc.). InforTech contributes its expertise in signal processing and telecommunications to the project.
