Title: Using software containers for profiling and modeling Machine Learning and QoS-constrained applications towards energy savings in multi-core architectures
Author:  Prof. Wellington Souza,  Instituto Metropole Digital - Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte

In this talk, we present a container-based methodology for profiling and modeling time-varying workloads through hardware performance counters. Using Machine Learning and QoS-constrained applications as use cases, we raise considerations on how to balance performance and energy savings in multi-core architectures.
