Video games industry relies on game engine (such as Unity, Unreal Engine, etc.) to create virtual environments, characters, etc. These game engines provide interface to build character animation. Although these methods allow a total control on animation, it takes a lot of time and resources to achieve a natural and expressive motion result. Recently, deep learning algorithms have been developed for automatic real-time controlled motion generation to help animators in this task. This presentation will briefly present these methods and the contributions of each of those.
