Energy efficiency is a growing concern for modern computing, especially for HPC due to operational costs and the environmental impact, considering that processors have an important role in this energy consumption. In this presentation, we show a methodology developed to find energy-optimal frequency and number of active cores to run single-node HPC applications using an application-agnostic power model of the architecture and an architecture-aware performance model of the application. We characterize the application performance using Support Vector Regression. Besides that, the power consumption is estimated by modeling CMOS dynamic and static power without knowledge of the application. So, The energy-optimal configuration is estimated by minimizing the product these two models outcomes, the power model and the performance model. Then, the final model can be used to find better frequency and number of cores to aim energy efficiency application execution. Results were obtained for four PARSEC applications and, with five different inputs shows that the proposed approach used substantially less energy when compared to the default Linux energy saving sh, in best cases and worst cases.
