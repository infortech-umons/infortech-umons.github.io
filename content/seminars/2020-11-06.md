Modern instrumentation needs to be done remotely, either in the frame of academic experiments or industrial characterization, for many reasons, including improved accuracy and human safety. Software tools for remote instrumentation exist, but most of them do not meet all the four main specifications, i.e., reliability, adaptability, user-friendliness, and open source. This presentation offers a journey in open source programming for software remote instrumentation. Through the example of R-testbench, a Python package designed to meet the four specifications, it is proposed to discuss the main challenges and design choices. The ultimate objective is to build general guidelines for open source programming in critical applications.
