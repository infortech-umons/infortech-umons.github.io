Taking advantage of the growing number of cores in supercomputers to increase the scalabilty of parallel programs is an increasing challenge. Many advanced profiling tools have been developed to assist programmers in the process of analyzing data related to the execution of their program. Programmers can act upon the information generated by these data and make their programs reach higher performance levels. However, the information provided by profiling tools are generally designed to optimize the program for a specific execution environment, with a target number of cores and a target problem size. A code optimization driven towards scalability rather than specific performance requires the analysis of many distinct execution environments instead of details about a single environment. With the goal of providing more useful information for the analysis and optimization of code for parallel scalability, this work introduces an efficient way to visualize scalability trends of parallel programs.
