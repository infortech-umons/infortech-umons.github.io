This presentation will talk about the prototype we have developed during a 3-month research stay at LIST (Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology). When taking advantage of it, architects can collaborate on a designed model around a table, that displays a top-down view of the construction's surroundings. Around it, a 360° surround display setup presents the same scene to the users, but with additional viewpoints that include the designed geometry: a perspective view and a human point of view, that is also shared with (potentially remote) VR users. When wearing a AR headset (Hololens), users also see a 3D hologram of the designed geometry appear on the table. The various viewpoints can be controlled using tangible items placed directly on the table display and the parameters driving the architectural model can be tweaked the same way. Since those changes impact the generated geometry, all views update instantly, allowing efficient collaboration between stakeholders in a multi-modal setup.
