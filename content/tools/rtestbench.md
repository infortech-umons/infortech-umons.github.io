 [R-testbench](https://rtestbench.readthedocs.io) is an open source toolkit written in Python that allows the user to create a software remote test bench to control an actual electronic test bench remotely. It relies on the VISA protocol (Virtual Instrument Software Architecture). The implementation is built on top of PyVISA.
